# Odin Recipes

A website to show my favourite recipes in a nice, easy-to read way


## Introduction

This project aims to provide recipes to vistors, via visual clicking options to an individual recipe page. By completing this project, I will have demonstrated the following skills:

- [Skill 1]: Applied base HTML syntax by using tags and attributes. 
- [Skill 2]: Used version control by committing to github
- [Skill 3]: Learned design by taking an idea and creating a webpage based on pre-determined specs.

Note: This list will change as new things are learned.

## Installation

This project can be viewed directly on github via pages.

## Usage

This project will simply offer you visual options of dishes and will load a given recipe page based on selection.
