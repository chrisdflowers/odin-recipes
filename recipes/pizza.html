    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Dough</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2.5 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup warm water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      </ul>
    <h3>Sauce</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 can (14 ounces) crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
      </ul>
    <h3>Toppings</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>Pepperoni slices</li>
        <li>Sliced bell peppers</li>
        <li>Sliced mushrooms</li>
        <li>Diced onions</li>
        <li>Fresh basil leaves</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small bowl, combine warm water, sugar, and yeast. Let it sit for about 5 minutes until it becomes frothy.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together flour and salt. Make a well in the center and pour in the yeast mixture and olive oil.</li>
        <li>Mix the ingredients together until a dough forms. Transfer the dough to a floured surface and knead it for about 5-7 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic.</li>
        <li>Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover it with a clean kitchen towel, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1-2 hours until it doubles in size.</li>
        <li>While the dough is rising, prepare the sauce. In a saucepan, combine crushed tomatoes, minced garlic, dried oregano, dried basil, sugar, salt, and pepper. Simmer the sauce over low heat for about 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C) and place a pizza stone or baking sheet inside to heat up.</li>
        <li>Once the dough has risen, punch it down and transfer it to a floured surface. Roll it out into your desired pizza shape and thickness.</li>
        <li>Transfer the rolled-out dough onto a piece of parchment paper. This will make it easier to transfer the pizza onto the preheated baking surface later.</li>
        <li>Spread a generous amount of the prepared sauce onto the dough, leaving a small border around the edges for the crust.</li>
        <li>Now comes the fun part - add your desired toppings such as mozzarella cheese, pepperoni slices, bell peppers, mushrooms, onions, and fresh basil leaves.</li>
        <li>Carefully transfer the pizza, along with the parchment paper, onto the preheated baking surface.</li>
        <li>Bake the pizza in the preheated oven for about 12-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.</li>
        <li>Once baked, remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
    </ol>
